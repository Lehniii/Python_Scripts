# Python_Scripts
Just some scripts i have coded feel free to use and change

## Organizing:
### sortfiles.py
This script organizes files from a source directory into different destination folders based on their file extensions. It creates the necessary destination folders if they don't exist and ensures that files are moved to their corresponding categorized folders, making it easier to manage and access files of different types.

**Usage:**
python sortfiles.py -sourcepath "sourcepath" -destinationpath "destinationpath"
