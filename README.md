## Organizing:
### sortfiles.py

It creates the necessary destination folders if they don't exist and ensures that files are moved to their corresponding categorized folders, making it easier to manage and access files of different types.

**Usage:**
python sortfiles.py -sourcepath "sourcepath" -destinationpath "destinationpath"


### download_duplicates.py
This script automatically finds and removes duplicate files with appended numbers in the filenames from your Windows Downloads folder, helping you keep your Downloads folder organized and clutter-free. Use it with caution and consider backing up important files before running the script.

**Usage:**
